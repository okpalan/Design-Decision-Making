### 1. **Introduction: Setting the Context**

- **Define Design Decisions**: Begin by explaining what design decisions are and why they matter. Mention that every choice in a project influences the final outcome, from user interface elements to system architecture.
- **Importance of Problem Solving**: Tie design decisions to problem solving. Emphasize that good design is about solving the right problems effectively.

### 2. **The Design Decision Process**

- **Understand the Problem**: Before making any design decisions, identify the problem you're trying to solve. This includes understanding the user needs, technical limitations, and project goals.
- **Research and Data Gathering**: Highlight the importance of data—user feedback, market research, or analytics—to inform design choices.
- **Prioritization**: Discuss how to prioritize problems and solutions, weighing factors like cost, impact, and feasibility.
- **Collaboration**: Mention how working with stakeholders—designers, developers, and business analysts—can help guide informed decisions.

### 3. **Framework for Effective Decision-Making**

- **Defining Criteria**: Explain the criteria you should use to make decisions (e.g., user experience, scalability, performance).
- **Evaluation of Alternatives**: Showcase how to evaluate different solutions for a given problem. Provide examples of comparing options and their trade-offs.
- **Making the Decision**: Provide examples of when it’s better to make quick decisions or when deep analysis is required.
- **Feedback Loops and Iteration**: Acknowledge that decisions are rarely final. Discuss the importance of testing, getting feedback, and iterating on the design.

### 4. **Real-World Examples**

- Share examples of design decisions in famous products or projects.
- Include any personal experiences where a design decision made a significant impact, either positively or negatively.

### 5. **Common Pitfalls in Design Decisions**

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Warning against overthinking decisions to the point of inaction.
- **Ignoring User Feedback**: The danger of assuming you know what users need without validating your assumptions.
- **Over-Optimization**: Highlight how focusing too much on a specific area, like performance or aesthetics, can negatively affect the overall product.

### 6. **Problem Solving Techniques**

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Teach methods like the “5 Whys” to dig deeper into the actual problem.
- **Brainstorming and Ideation**: Mention techniques for generating multiple solutions before narrowing down.
- **Prototyping and Testing**: Stress how early testing with prototypes or mockups helps validate design decisions.
- **Feedback and Adaptability**: The ability to adjust based on user testing or changes in requirements.

### 7. **Conclusion**

- Reinforce the idea that design is about solving problems creatively.
- Mention the importance of being open to iteration and new data as the project evolves.
